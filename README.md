## DESCRIPTION OF TASK

The **File Handling Utility** project is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of file operations in Java. File handling is an essential part of software development, enabling programs to store, retrieve, and update data persistently. This project provides a simple yet effective utility that performs three core operations on text files:

1. **Write to a File** – The program allows users to create a new text file or overwrite an existing one with new content. This ensures that fresh data can be stored easily.
   
2. **Read from a File** – Users can view the contents of an existing text file, with the program reading and displaying its contents line by line. This is useful for accessing stored data in a clear and structured format.
   
3. **Modify (Append) a File** – Instead of replacing the entire content, the program also enables appending new text to the existing file. This makes it convenient for updating logs, notes, or records without losing previous information.

The implementation is interactive, menu-driven, and user-friendly, allowing users to select the operation they want to perform. Exception handling is integrated to manage errors such as missing files or invalid input, ensuring robustness.

By working on this project, interns gain practical exposure to Java I/O classes such as `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, `FileReader`, and `BufferedReader`. This strengthens their understanding of Java’s file-handling capabilities and prepares them for handling real-world scenarios where persistent data management is required.

Overall, this project not only enhances programming skills but also demonstrates how simple utilities can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications like text editors, log managers, and data processors.
